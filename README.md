# Pythagoras
Pythagoras is a game that donates money towards children's education (through Children International)! The app displays a math problem on the screen and the player enters their answer. If the answer is correct, 1 is added to a counter that keeps track of the player's correct answers. Every 5 answers triggeres a banner or pop-up ad, and that ad revenue is donated to children's education.
